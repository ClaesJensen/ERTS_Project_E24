# ERTS_Project_E24
The project for our Embedded Real Time Systems project. The project will revolve around creating an embedded audio interface, that takes an audio signal in and outputs an audio signal. The audio will on the board be processed via different effects. For the minimum effects there will be implemented an equalizer and a convolving reverb effect.
